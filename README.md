  // Join BuildProfit engineer marketers
    $buildProfit = new \BuildProfit\BuildProfitToolkit( $existingIdeaOrProject );

    // refine your value proposition
  $buildProfit->identifyMarketFit();

  // cut the noise and figure out the best way to promote
  $buildProfit->filterMarketingOpportunities();

  // level up with our tools or guides
  // execute effective marketing actions quickly and easily
  $buildProfit->executeMarketingActions();
